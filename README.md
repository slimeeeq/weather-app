# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to search for weather information by entering the name of a city. It fetches the weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays the current temperature and weather condition for that city.

### Features

- **City Search**: Users can input the name of a city.
- **Fetch Weather Data**: The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name.
- **Display Weather**: It shows the temperature (in Celsius) and weather condition (e.g., "Clear sky", "Rainy", etc.) for the selected city.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the basic structure of the app (form input and output display).
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a simple, user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user input, fetch data from the API, and display the weather information.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather data based on city names.
